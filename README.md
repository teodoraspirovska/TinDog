# What I have learned
This project allowed me to develop a responsive website called TinDog using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. With a visually appealing design and Bootstrap's pre-designed components, I created a platform where dog owners can connect and find potential matches for their dogs.

Through this project, I gained valuable skills in front-end web development. I became proficient in HTML and CSS, utilizing them to structure and style the web pages effectively. By implementing Bootstrap, I learned how to leverage its powerful grid system and pre-designed components to create responsive and consistent layouts across various devices.

Incorporating Font Awesome icons, I enhanced the visual appeal of the website by adding scalable vector icons. Additionally, I applied Google Fonts to improve the typography, making the text more visually appealing and readable.

The project also provided an opportunity to work with JavaScript, as I utilized it to add interactivity and functionality to the web pages. I implemented features such as a carousel slider for testimonials and form validation for a user-friendly experience.

Throughout the development process, I followed web development best practices, ensuring semantic HTML markup, optimizing page load speed, and prioritizing accessibility and responsiveness.
