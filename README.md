# TinDog
This project is a responsive website called TinDog, designed to help dog owners connect and find potential matches for their dogs, built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

# What I have learned
This project allowed me to develop a responsive website called TinDog using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. With a visually appealing design and Bootstrap's pre-designed components, I created a platform where dog owners can connect and find potential matches for their dogs.

Through this project, I gained valuable skills in front-end web development. I became proficient in HTML and CSS, utilizing them to structure and style the web pages effectively. By implementing Bootstrap, I learned how to leverage its powerful grid system and pre-designed components to create responsive and consistent layouts across various devices.

Incorporating Font Awesome icons, I enhanced the visual appeal of the website by adding scalable vector icons. Additionally, I applied Google Fonts to improve the typography, making the text more visually appealing and readable.

The project also provided an opportunity to work with JavaScript, as I utilized it to add interactivity and functionality to the web pages. I implemented features such as a carousel slider for testimonials and form validation for a user-friendly experience.

Throughout the development process, I followed web development best practices, ensuring semantic HTML markup, optimizing page load speed, and prioritizing accessibility and responsiveness. 

The source code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository, showcasing my practical experience and proficiency in web development, responsive design, and utilizing popular frameworks and tools.
